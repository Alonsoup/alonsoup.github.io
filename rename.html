        One of the people I have learned most from is my friend Jorge Pellicer. He taught me photography, video production, film appreciation and many other things.
        When he was teaching me about video editing, he told me that the most laborious part was the classification of the material shot during production.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don't keep a tight order, you'll have to dive in a huge pool of poorly named files every time you want to add a new shot.
        So Jorge spends hours previewing, right-clicking and renaming his files, adding a rating and information about the type of shot, the subject, wheter there's a tilt, pan, zoom or dolly and other stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel like I owe him a better solution, so I'm working on a Python program that will make the job a bit easier.
      </p>
      <h3>rename.py</h3>
      <p>
        First, we'll need a loop that will go through every file in a folder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, we need to preview that file so we know what to name it. I think the way to approach this is through an image manipulation library called "Pillow".
      </p>
      <p>
        We need a better way of inputting the new name, so I designed a Tkinter interface that builds the new name through buttons or keyboard shortcuts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we need to add a stop-light rating: green for good, amber for regular and red for barely usable.
