        Back when I was a translation student, I somehow got the job of dubbing a documentary. <br>
        I had no idea what I was getting into, but I agreed to work with two other translators and have the job done in a few weeks. <br>
        We encountered so many challenges that we had to give up the project and apologize to the client for wasting her time. <br>
        This was very discouraging, but I realized none of the problems had to do with our ability to translate. So what was stopping us?
      </p>
      <p>
        We realized a few things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We had no idea how to record a voice, let alone matching it to a video.</li>
        <li>There were three of us and more than 20 different characters.</li>
        <li>Translating from audio to text takes so long that it's even faster to make a transcript and then translate.</li>
        <li>We had no way to keep the music and sound design while quieting the original voice tracks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Years later, I worked for a video production company, where I became familiar with a lot of processes, software and techniques that would have been handy. <br>
        Even mastering these, that particular project was too ambitious, but I would have had the sense to turn it down.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I attempted to do with this workshop was to give this same experience to other translation students and make them feel empowered, instead of discouraged.
        I wanted them to be able to choose projects wisely and to deliver a good product.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started by researching best practices and trying different tools and steps until I developed a workflow that was both efficient and easy to learn.
        I structured all the valuable insights I had gained and I designed the workshop so that the students could learn from one another with a hands-on approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I had a valuable system. I just needed students.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used my web development skills to create a one-page that would describe the course and sign people up and I uploaded it to my website.
